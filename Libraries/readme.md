# Libraries

I made some changes to it based on this libbrerie of DHT [Pull requests #138](https://github.com/adafruit/DHT-sensor-library/pull/138 "Fixed signed/unsigned and unused parameter warnings")

The library to be imported with the correction is in the zip, it is sufficient to decompress it in the folder ..\Documents\Arduino\libraries\.

## Libraries List

Here are the lepers used for the code:

- Adafruit SGP30 Air Quality Sensor Breakout

I recommend installing all the dependencies that arduino IDE offers
